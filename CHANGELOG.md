# Changelog

All notable changes to PennyWallet will be documented in this file.

## [0.0.23] - 2026-10-03

### Added
- Add/Edit Transaction: typing `[[` in the Note field suggests matching notes from the vault (fuzzy match on the note name, then the path; recently edited notes when nothing is typed yet). Picking one inserts `[[Note name]]`, using a folder-qualified link only when needed. Works on desktop and mobile.

### Changed
- Minimum Obsidian version is now 1.6.6 (needed for the note suggestions).

## [0.0.22] - 2026-10-03

### Changed
- Add/Edit Transaction: the Account field is gone for expenses and income (desktop and mobile). They are recorded against the Default Account from Settings; income skips a credit-card default and uses the first cash/bank account. Transfers keep their From / To accounts, and editing keeps a transaction's existing account.

### Fixed
- Dropdowns in the transaction form, settings and validation report showed white text on a white list in dark themes; the open list now follows the Obsidian theme.
- Android: tapping Date in the Add/Edit Transaction form did nothing; it now opens the calendar.

## [0.0.21] - 2026-10-03

### Added
- Budgets tab: a new header tab (and "Open budgets" command) showing, for the selected month, total budgeted / spent / left, a card per budget with a progress bar, a "today" marker for the current month (orange when spending is ahead of pace, red when over), percentage used, a suggested daily amount for the rest of the month, recent transactions with a link to all of them, and the month's unbudgeted expenses.

### Changed
- Transactions list: rows no longer show the account line; a row's budget is now shown next to its category.

## [0.0.20] - 2026-10-03

### Added
- Budgets: create budgets with a monthly amount in Settings → Budgets (rename, change amount, or delete them inline).
- Add/Edit Transaction: expenses can be assigned to a budget (desktop and mobile). The `obsidian://penny-wallet-mod` URI also accepts `budget=`.
- Overview: a Budgets card shows, for the selected month, how much of each budget is spent and how much is left or over. Refunds give money back to the budget, and budgets reset every month. Clicking a budget opens its transactions.
- Transactions list: budgeted rows show the budget name, search matches budget names, and the list can be filtered by budget.

### Changed
- Month files gain an optional 11th `Budget` column, written only for budgeted rows so unbudgeted rows stay readable by the original PennyWallet plugin.

## [0.0.19] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed
- Add Transaction: tags longer than 10 characters (e.g. `friends_family`) could not be added. Tags without Chinese characters can now be up to 30 characters; the 5-character limit for Chinese tags is unchanged.

## [0.0.18] - 2026-10-03

### Changed
- Transactions list: `[[wikilinks]]` in a transaction's note are now rendered as clickable internal links (with hover preview); clicking one opens the linked note instead of the edit modal. Unresolved links use Obsidian's unresolved-link style.
- Transactions list: long notes now wrap onto multiple lines instead of being truncated with an ellipsis.

## [0.0.17] - 2026-10-03

### Changed
- Transactions list: each row now shows the note on its own line, followed by the tags on a separate line below it (replaces the single shared line from 0.0.16). Rows with neither still show an em dash.

## [0.0.16] - 2026-10-03

### Changed
- Fork ("PennyWallet Mod"): plugin id is now `penny-wallet-mod` so it can be installed next to the original PennyWallet. View types, the refresh event and the `obsidian://penny-wallet-mod` URI handler are renamed to avoid clashing with the original. The `.penny-wallet.json` config and the transaction files are intentionally still shared with the original plugin.
- Transactions list: line 3 of each row now shows tags and the note together instead of tags or note.

## [0.0.15] - 2026-05-24

### Fixed
- TagPicker search input no longer interrupts IME composition (iOS Bopomofo / desktop IME), preventing dropped characters when typing tags

## [0.0.14] - 2026-05-17

### Changed
- ribbon / view icon switched to built-in lucide `wallet` (removed custom SVG registration)

### Internal
- scope month-file listing to plugin folder — replace `vault.getMarkdownFiles()` with `getFolderByPath().children` to remove the "Vault Enumeration" disclosure from Obsidian plugin reviewer
- pin vite to `^8` in devDependencies — prevents accidental downgrade (stylelint install silently regressed vite to 6.x, breaking obsidian package resolution in tests)

## [0.0.13] - 2026-05-17

### Changed
- replace CSS `:has()` keyboard rules with JS class toggles for iOS keyboard compensation
- remove all `!important` declarations (79 → 0) by bumping selector specificity (doubled/tripled `.pw-transaction-modal-container` / `.pw-bottom-sheet` / etc.) to beat Obsidian's mobile modal rules
- unify done-button class name: `pw-bottom-sheet-btn-primary` → `pw-bottom-sheet-btn--done` so filter sheet's Done button is bold + right-aligned
- fix CSS lint warnings: duplicate selectors, hex color format, asset wallet row class rename
- rename i18n keys `cat.*` / `walletType.*` / `type.*` → `label.cat.*` / `label.walletType.*` / `label.type.*` so key namespace encodes UI role
- rewrite 19 en UI strings to sentence case per Obsidian style guideline (e.g., "Add Transaction" → "Add transaction", "Net Assets" → "Net assets")

### Fixed
- filter sheet backdrop now covers Obsidian's bottom toolbar on mobile (`openFilterSheet` extracted from shared shell; backdrop attached to `document.body` to escape leaf transformed-ancestor containing block)
- bottom sheet picker search input not typeable on iOS (backdrop attached to containerEl)
- bottom sheet search placeholder and no-match text not i18n'd
- refund checkbox too close to label (added gap)

### Internal
- add stylelint with minimal rules (`declaration-no-important`, `selector-disallowed-list` for `:has()`, `no-duplicate-selectors`, `declaration-block-no-duplicate-properties`, `color-hex-length`) — run via `npm run lint:css`
- add i18n sentence-case linter (`scripts/lint-i18n.mjs`) that skips `label.*` namespace — run via `npm run lint:i18n`

## [0.0.12] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- add mobile calculator state
- add mobile calculator pad component
- wire mobile calculator modal flow
- refine mobile calculator sheet
- add ⌫ backspace and 00 keys to mobile calculator
- add Done key to mobile calculator (resolves pending expression then closes pad)

### Changed
- update mobile calculator layout
- move calculator formula to sheet title bar
- rework mobile calculator layout (all operators on top row; =/C/⌫/Done in right column)
- improve mobile calculator pressed-state visual feedback and unify sheet background

## [0.0.11] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- **Wallet filter multi-select** — both the mobile filter sheet and the desktop dropdown now accept multiple wallets

### Changed
- **Filter pill colorway** — type / category / wallet pills get a tinted active state (same-color border, same-color text, translucent same-color fill); neutral pill uses `--interactive-accent`; base size bumped to 14px to match the tag picker chip
- **Pill family** — tag picker chips consolidate into the `.pw-pill` family; category pill active drops the trailing ✓ marker

### Fixed
- Dark theme filter pill active fill not rendering — `:root` declarations referencing `--interactive-accent` failed to resolve (Obsidian declares the token on `body`); moved the affected vars to `body`

### Internal
- Filled variant preserved as git tag `pill-style-filled` (commit `cda9093`) for one-shot switching

## [0.0.10] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- **Refund as negative expense** — new「這是退款」toggle in the expense form saves the transaction with a negative amount; refunds render as a lighter green `+amount` in the list, distinguishable from regular income at a glance; migration script `scripts/migrate-refund.mjs` converts legacy `transfer credit_card_refund` records to the new format
- **Income wallet selector** — credit card accounts are now excluded from the income wallet picker

### Changed
- **Transaction modal redesign** — single accent colour (only Confirm is blue; title / type tabs / Cancel all neutral grey); refund toggle + inline hint grouped in a bordered sub-option block under the type tabs, with a desktop hover tooltip / mobile inline hint explaining that refunds are stored as negative expenses (`modal.isRefund.hint`); editing a refund (or toggling it on with an amount entered) shows a `+` prefix beside the amount — input prefix on desktop, hero prefix on mobile; mobile amount hero enlarged to 48 px / weight 500 with thousand-separated numbers (muted when empty, full-contrast when typed) and no `NT$` symbol; mobile top buttons shrunk to 32 × 32 visible / 44 pt touch; tag chip × hit area enlarged via padding without changing visible size; plain and wrapper-based field inputs (tag / amount wrappers) unified to one height with a single focus ring (nested input shadow suppressed)
- **Edit-mode cues, required markers, date affordance, transfer category reset** — edit modal title gains a pencil icon prefix and a subtitle「編輯 MM/DD 的交易」/「Editing transaction from MM/DD」using the source transaction's date; required fields (wallet, category, fromWallet, toWallet) now show a `*` after the label; the date input is cursor-pointer with an accent hover border on desktop and a `▾` caret beside the value on mobile; switching transaction type now clears `category` only when the current value isn't valid for the new type (amount, date, note, tags are still preserved across type switches)
- **Mobile tag picker** — replaces the mobile inline tag input with a bottom-sheet multi-select picker; chips render in alphabetical order with a unified oval style, tapping toggles selection (3-tag cap with disabled affordance on over-cap unselected chips); the picker's search input doubles as a new-tag entry — an inline「+ 新增「name」」 button appears between search and the chip list when typing so it stays reachable above the keyboard, and a bottom「+ 新增標籤」row prompts when search is empty; new tags persist via the new `WalletFile.addTag` helper (trim, strip leading `#`, dedupe, alphabetical insert, save). The mobile modal's tag row is now display-only chips (matching the picker's selected style) plus a muted「選擇標籤」placeholder; tapping anywhere on the row opens the picker. Desktop tag row is unchanged
- **Charts** — migrated to Chart.js for more stable rendering and a smaller bundle; pie chart merges small categories into "Others" with tap-to-drill-down; tooltip now shows amount and percentage
- **Transaction list** — action buttons reveal on hover (desktop) / stay visible (mobile) for a cleaner default layout
- **Shared styling** — unified CSS colour tokens; refactored shared `Card` and `Metric` components

### Fixed
- **Modal polish** — removed stray outer border inherited from Obsidian theme; restored checkbox appearance so it renders correctly across themes; added consistent separator lines between field rows; suppressed Obsidian's purple focus outline on type tabs

### Removed
- **Legacy refund category** — `credit_card_refund` transfer category removed (replaced by the negative-expense format above)

### Internal
- **Modal architecture refactor** — extracted 6 pure helpers (`parseAmountForEdit`, `validateTransactionForm`, `buildTransactionPayload`, `addTagToList`, `getCategoryOptions`, `getTransferWalletCandidates`) from `TransactionModal` into a dedicated `src/modal/transactionState.ts` module with 46 unit tests; deduplicated `MobileTransactionModal` against `TransactionModal` by lifting 4 stateful operations (`getActiveWallets`, `normalizeWalletForCategory`, `resetStateForType`, `getFormState`) to protected base-class methods; 10 verbatim duplicate sites collapsed; no user-visible behavior change

## [0.0.9] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- Data validation: detects malformed transaction rows and surfaces errors in the UI

### Fixed
- Mobile tag dropdown on iOS no longer triggers the system keyboard; uses native tap-to-select flow instead

### Added
- Tags field on each transaction for flexible labeling and filtering

## [0.0.7] - 2026-04-14

### Changed
- Merged `repayment` transaction type into `transfer` — existing repayments are read as `transfer` with category `credit_card_payment`
- Renamed transfer type label from 「轉帳」to 「移轉」(zh) / "Transfer" (en)
- `translateCategory`: empty, `-`, and `other` values now display as 「未分類」/ "Uncategorized" instead of a dash
- Category defaults are now always normalized on config load (`normalizeOptions`), ignoring stale stored defaults

### Added
- Expanded default expense categories: `clothing`, `education`, `cash_expense`, `insurance`, `fees`, `tax`
- Expanded default income categories: `interest`, `lottery`, `rent`, `cashback`, `dividend`, `investment_profit`, `insurance_income`, `pension`
- Default transfer categories: `account_transfer`, `credit_card_payment`, `credit_card_refund`, `investment_trade`
- Custom transfer categories section in Settings
- `scripts/migrate-categories.mjs` — migrates old ledger rows (`repayment`→`transfer`, `other`→`-`) and `.penny-wallet.json` config to the new schema

### Fixed
- `credit_card_refund` balance calculation now correctly adjusts only the single credit card wallet (not double-counted)
- `credit_card_payment` balance calculation now decreases both bank (from) and credit card debt (to)

## [0.0.6] - 2026-04-11

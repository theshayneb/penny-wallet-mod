# Data Format

PennyWallet stores all data as plain text files in your vault. No proprietary database, no binary files.

---

## File Structure

```
<vault>/
├── .obsidian/plugins/penny-wallet-mod/data.json   ← plugin config (synced by Obsidian Sync)
└── PennyWallet/             ← monthly transaction files (folder name configurable)
    ├── 2026-04.md
    ├── 2026-03.md
    └── 2026-02.md
```

## Monthly Transaction Files

Each file covers one calendar month and contains two parts: a **frontmatter cache** and a **Markdown table**.

### Example: `2026-04.md`

```markdown
---
income: 72000
expense: 18450
netAsset: 0
---

### Column Reference

| Column | expense / income | transfer |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Date | `MM/DD` | `MM/DD` |
| Type | `expense` / `income` | `transfer` |
| Wallet | account name | `-` |
| From | `-` | source account |
| To | `-` | destination account |
| Category | category key or custom name | transfer category key or custom name |
| Note | optional text | optional text |
| Tags | comma-separated tags or `-` | comma-separated tags or `-` |
| Amount | positive number; refund expenses use a negative number | positive number |
| CreatedAt | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp |
| Budget | optional (expense only): budget name, e.g. `Groceries` | not used |

The **Budget** column is an optional 11th column. It is only written for rows that are assigned to a budget; other rows keep 10 columns, so they stay readable by the original PennyWallet plugin (which ignores rows with more than 10 columns).

### Frontmatter Cache

The `income`, `expense`, and `netAsset` fields at the top are a cache used for fast loading in the Finance Overview and Assets views. They are recomputed automatically whenever a transaction is added, edited, or deleted.

> Do not edit the frontmatter manually — it will be overwritten on the next transaction write.

## Config File: `data.json`

Stored in the plugin's own folder, `.obsidian/plugins/penny-wallet-mod/data.json`, like other plugins' settings. Obsidian Sync carries it to your other devices when **Settings → Sync → Vault configuration sync → Installed community plugins** is on, and the plugin reloads it automatically when Sync updates it.

Older versions stored the config in `.penny-wallet.json` at the vault root, which Obsidian Sync never syncs (it skips files starting with a dot). On first launch, the plugin copies that file into `data.json` and leaves the old file untouched; after that it is no longer read.

```json
{
  "wallets": [
    {
      "name": "Cash",
      "type": "cash",
      "initialBalance": 5000,
      "status": "active",
      "includeInNetAsset": true
    },
    {
      "name": "Visa Platinum",
      "type": "creditCard",
      "initialBalance": 2000,
      "status": "active",
      "includeInNetAsset": true
    }
  ],
  "defaultWallet": "Cash",
  "folderName": "PennyWallet",
  "decimalPlaces": 0,
  "options": {
    "types": { "default": ["expense", "income", "transfer"], "custom": [] },
    "categories": {
      "expense": { "default": ["food", "clothing", "housing", "transport", "education", "entertainment", "shopping", "medical", "cash_expense", "insurance", "fees", "tax"], "custom": ["Coffee"] },
      "income":  { "default": ["salary", "interest", "side_income", "bonus", "lottery", "rent", "cashback", "dividend", "investment_profit", "insurance_income", "pension"], "custom": [] },
      "transfer": { "default": ["account_transfer", "credit_card_payment", "investment_trade"], "custom": [] }
    }
  },
  "tags": [],
  "budgets": [{ "name": "Groceries", "amount": 500 }],
  "autoValidateOnLoad": true
}
```

## Git Sync Compatibility

The plain Markdown format works seamlessly with Obsidian Git or any other sync plugin:

- Each month is a separate file → minimal merge conflicts
- The config file changes only when you update settings or accounts
- Binary files: none

---

## Dataview Compatibility

Since transactions are stored as Markdown tables, you can query them with [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview).

Dataview reads frontmatter fields directly. You can use it to query the monthly summary values stored at the top of each file:

**Example — list monthly income and expense across all months:**

```dataview
TABLE income, expense, (income - expense) AS balance
FROM "PennyWallet"
WHERE income != null
SORT file.name ASC
```

**Example — find months where expenses exceeded income:**

```dataview
LIST file.name
FROM "PennyWallet"
WHERE expense > income
```

> Note: Dataview reads the **frontmatter cache** (income/expense totals per month), not individual transaction rows. For per-transaction queries, the Markdown table format is not natively supported by Dataview — use the raw file or a custom DataviewJS script.

---

## Manual Editing

You can edit the Markdown files directly in Obsidian. Follow the column format exactly:
- Dates must be `MM/DD`
- Use `-` for unused columns (not empty)
- Amount must be a plain number (no currency symbols or commas)
- Refunds are stored as `expense` rows with a negative amount
- `CreatedAt` is auto-assigned when writing through the UI — do not edit it manually, as it is used for stable same-date ordering

After manual edits, PennyWallet will re-read the file on the next view render. The frontmatter cache will be updated automatically on the next transaction write to that month.
